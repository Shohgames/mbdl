First and foremost, the goal of this script is to download any files that are hosted on this platform
    To do this, I will probably have to check the api requests and just find the correct endpoints, and hope that i can infinetly (how the hell am i supposed to spell this shit) request without getting blocked

    I guess i also want to make it so that i can give login credidentials just like that and have it display the contents and just give me shit

So yapping aside, shit to do:

    - Plan on how to scrape data
    - Make the scraper hard to detect
    - Make a crawler for the contents hosted for the user
    - Make a simple frontend for the folk to download shit

1/1 9:29 seems like its just a ruby rails shit
1/2 7:33 general plan is done, just take data and scrape based on the api points plain and simpple
1/2 10:02 decided to go with a flask server
            X make sure to put a venv, freeze the venv and upload it to git
            _ mkae a simple http server replicate the apis with bruno
1/12 18:30 had shitton of work to do so the project got delayed for a week freaking hell
anyways, decided to go witha  simple broswer automation with tihs lib called helium? sounds cool lets test it out.
